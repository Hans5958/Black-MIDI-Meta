​​​Someone once told me that the world would roll me  
I'm not the sharpest tool in the warehouse  
She looks silent with her fingers and thumb  
In the "L" shape on the forehead  
  
Yes, years start coming and they do not stop  
Fed for the rules and I hit the ground running  
No sense to not live happily  
Your brain becomes smart but your head becomes dumb  
  
A lot of work to do, a lot of things to see  
So, what's wrong with getting the street back?  
You will never know if you do not go  
You will never shine if you do not glow  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, now, you're an All Star, let's play your game, play  
Hey, now, you're a rock star, get on the show, get paid  
And all that is brilliant is gold  
Only the new meteors break the mold  
  
It was a great place and they said it was getting colder  
Now you are ready to wait until you are older  
But the meteors beg for differences  
Reviewed by holes in satellite imagery  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
Someone once asked me if I could pardon some changes to gas  
I need to stay away from this place  
I said, a concept  
I can use some fuel myself  
And we can all use a little change  
  
Yes, years start coming and they do not stop  
Fed for the rules and I hit the ground running  
No sense to not live happily  
Your brain becomes smart but your head becomes dumb  
  
A lot of work to do, a lot of things to see  
So, what's wrong with getting the street back?  
You will never know if you do not go  
You will never shine if you do not glow.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And all that is brilliant is gold  
Only the new meteors break the mold​​

## amd

​᠎᠎᠎I don't prefer AMD. I prefer Intel ~~Petinum~~ Pentium instead.

*Except Ryzen, they're better. I hope the other AMD is as good as it.*


Shut up, AMD weaboos.

He has a form of a cat but has a shape-liked humanoid. People says you should beware of him. Because his word can send you to visible imcomprehendsions and exiles you out of your beloved village.

## avatar

​Water. Earth. Fire. Air.  
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.  
Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished.  
A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang, and although his airbending skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.  
But I believe Aang can save the world.
