### Domino English Translation

Domino is MIDI editor that is used for creating MIDI songs/musics. Domino is used by various blackers in the Black MIDI ecosystem.

Since Domino is an abandonware, and it's original language is Japanese, many people tried to translate it using resource editing tools. Some of it are outdated, while others are incomplete.

This repository is made to unify the translations made by community, while trying to complete it for easier usage.

You can visit the repository on <https://github.com/Hans5958/Domino-English-Translation/>. You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Hans5958/Domino-English-Translation/releases).


### List of Largest MIDIs

This is a list for the large MIDI songs that the community has ever made.

This list was actually long abandoned by wiki contributors, so there are lots of MIDIs that's not on the list. Because of that, I try to maintain it as long as I can. The list has developed from as small as 124 songs to as big as over 300 songs.

The update is monthly and you can submit MIDIs by contacting me in any way you can, such as Discord or the wiki page.

You can read more info inside [Black MIDI Meta Docs](large-list/index.md). Otherwise, you can visit [the spreadsheet on Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sldrGkhU41FakmdFfUL3Z1GMT2LOQzx81yy4D_ZLxKk/edit).
