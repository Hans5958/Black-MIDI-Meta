# List of Largest MIDIs

This is a spreadsheet for the list of largest MIDIs.
It is based on [the wiki page](https://officialblackmidi.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Largest_MIDIs).

Contributions are appreciated, especially the original title from the blacker, missing fields, like note intesity, size, source, etc, and finding new songs.

You can view the spreadsheet in the frame below or in [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sldrGkhU41FakmdFfUL3Z1GMT2LOQzx81yy4D_ZLxKk/edit#gid=1711202812).

## Background

There are a lot of MIDIs that are undocumented, so I tried to put it on the list.
The list has developed from 124 songs into more than 200 songs from various blackers and creators.

This spreadsheet is created because of the page protection on the said wiki page.
Even if the page is unlocked, MediaWiki tables suck, so I'll just keep it.

## Methodology

The methodology of adding this MIDIs is listed below.

1. The blackers/creators must be known.  
The methods could be, but not limited to, the MIDI is played by a person with high reputation on Black MIDI (ex. BMT), or it can be found on the first page on the YouTube search.

2. The blacked songs must have any evidence and it's not fabricated and using the original blacker video if possible.  
One example of fabrication is PipiraMine's video of an April Fools MIDI that is created on Ultralight MIDI Player. Even though it is not real, the note counter is faked.
Troll editions are mostly accepted.

3. The title will be used is the ones that the blacker named.  
This to avoid any confusion by original naming of the song. It might be controversial.

4. Note counts must be stated, even as an aproximate, and only be listed with a minimum of ten (10) million notes.

5. Sizes are inserted using maximum of three (3) significant numbers.  
For example, 25,1 MB, 203 MB, 1,64 GB, 56,4 GB, 592 GB, etc. 20 MB, 2 GB, etc is fine.

6. Revisions/versions/updates are valid if there it is not updated after two months or a major update.

7. All merges are listed with "[merger] and others".

8. The song must be in the MIDI (.mid) form.  
No programs, such as 93 trilion MIDI generator. It can be compressed.

Some songs are removed from the list due to the source has lost or just hidden. (look Lost Songs)
